I double majored to obtain a BS in Applied Mathematics and Data Science and Analytics at Marist College. While there, I took particular interest in fostering community and promoting accessability and enthusiasm for these fields. I am looking forward to continue the exploration into the many ways data science can help us understand the universe, ourselves, and each other in industry and research.
